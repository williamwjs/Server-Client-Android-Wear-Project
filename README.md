We build a "Blue Bus Tracker" Android Wear app, together with the server, to help users track the blue bus based on the user's schedule and finally notify users so that they will not miss the bus. We also test the performance of this app with the battery saving, response time and accuracy, which proves our app works well under network scenario.
